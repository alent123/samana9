## 📚 Description

This lab focuses on understanding and implementing operations using:
- Generic trees
- Arithmetic expression trees
- Postfix conversion
- Tree evaluation and simplification

All challenges are developed in **Python** and include complete **test cases**.

---

## 🧩 Challenges Implemented

### ✅ Challenge 1: Infix to Postfix

**Goal:** Convert a mathematical expression from infix notation to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation), using operator precedence and parentheses.

- Implemented using the **Shunting Yard Algorithm**
- Includes test cases with constants and variables

---

### ✅ Challenge 2: Build Expression Tree from Infix

**Goal:** Construct an expression tree from an infix expression.

- Converts infix to postfix first
- Then builds the tree using a stack

---

### ✅ Challenge 3: Generic Tree Height

**Goal:** Calculate the height (depth) of a generic tree.

- Uses recursion to compute the maximum depth from root to leaf

---

### ✅ Challenge 4: Find All Leaves

**Goal:** Retrieve all leaf nodes (no children) in a generic tree.

- Depth-first search (DFS) traversal used
- Returns list of leaf node values

---

### ✅ Challenge 5: Expression Tree Simplification

**Goal:** Simplify an expression tree by evaluating subtrees with constant values.

- Performs **post-order traversal**
- Replaces constant subtrees with their result
- Leaves variables untouched
